Welcome to stratego, an implementation of the popular strategy board game

-There are two (optional) modes that you can enable, one being reduced mode, where less pieces are available, and the other one being No surrender, where pieces cannot move backwards

-Player 1 should make his board by clicking on 2 separate tiles and they will be switched
-After that, P1 should press the X at the top right so Player 2 can also set up their board

-After setting up boards, the game is played in turns with the goal being to capture the enemy flag
